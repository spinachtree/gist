sect	Welcome

This web-site is a small collection of software projects. The main project is Gist: a grammar language that is fun to use! It can be used for formal specifications, but it is automated so you can quickly run your grammar on input strings and see what syntax parse tree it generates. Its so easy to use and you can use it in much the same way that you would use a regular expression, but a grammar gives you more expressive power -- and it's much nicer to read than cryptic regular expressions.

The Gist grammar language itself is independent of any programming language. Over time I hope to make available implementations of the automated parser in different programming languages, but right now only the Java version is available.
