title	Gist in Java

Gist directly executes a PBNF grammar as a parser.

sect	To run demo examples

A Ruby script "demo" is provided to run sample files in the demos directory. For example:

	cd gist/java
	ruby demo arith

The format of the demo files should be self explanatory, add a demo text file to try your own grammar.

The same Ruby script could be run directly (it has a #!), but to do that you need to sort out the shell PATH and execution permission for the file. I find it easier just to invoke the Ruby interpreter.

In fact the demo script boils down to calling the Java class org.spinachtree.gist.Glib, so you can work without the Ruby script if you prefer.


sect	To run Java examples

A Ruby script is provided to run Java examples, for example:

	ruby example Arith

or directly as:

	java -cp gist.jar:class Arith

If you want to modify or add an example, compile it as:

	javac -d class -classpath gist.jar examples/MyExample.java


sect	To Use Gist

To use Gist you only need the gist.jar file, put it in your Java class path.

Example useage:

	import org.spinachtree.gist.*;

	public class Date  {

		public static void main(String[] args) {

			Gist ymd = new Gist(
			"Date  = year '-' month '-' day         \n"+
			"year  : d d d d                        \n"+
			"month : d d?                           \n"+
			"day   : d d?                           \n"+
			"d     : '0'..'9'                       \n");

			Parse date = ymd.parse("2001-2-3");
			System.out.println(date);
		}
	}

See javadoc for the syntax tree methods (using Span or Term nodes).


sect	To build from source

The Ruby build script will compile the Gist package from the source files (in src dir), then run tests, and build the Gist jar file. It also compiles the examples.

	cd gist/java
	ruby build
