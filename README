Gist is a grammar driven parser that can execute any PBNF grammar.

The doc directory contains a PBNF reference and general Gist information.

The demos directory shows some example PBNF grammars. The format of the demo files should be self explanatory, add a demo text file to try your own grammar.

The java directory contains a Java version of Gist, and the java/README file shows how to run the demos, and other Java application examples (remember to change your working directory with: cd java).
